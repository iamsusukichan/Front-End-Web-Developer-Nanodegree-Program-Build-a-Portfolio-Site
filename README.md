# üìãProject 1-Build a Portfolio Site

![Alt text](img/overview.png?raw=true)

This is my first project from Udacity Front End Nano Degree. It is an assessment after learning the intro to HTML and CSS, Responsive Web Design Fundamentals. In this project, I have used Bootstrap 4 for the responsive grid layout. All the elements would be in full width and centered for the smaller screens. Links at the bottoms are all clickable and related to my other platforms.
